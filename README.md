By Jarrett Dougherty

## Description
Storefront and Inventory App is a Node.js CLI program that mimics an Amazon-like store. Running the various JavaScript files in Node allows for three different user experiences, Customer, Manager, and Supervisor, each with its own functionality. Customers can view and buy items. Managers can check and add to inventory and create new items. Supervisors can check sales by department and create new departments. Each user experience relies on and interacts with the same database utilizing MySQL. The purpose of the app is to create a store-like environment that allows multiple types of dynamic interactions with a single server-side database.
